												<h2>What is stress?</h2>
												
											</header>

											<p>Being stressed is "a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances" (Merriam-Webster). You can get stressed from pressure to finish something before a deadline, family struggles, or anxiety. Levels of stress differ from person to person, so two people may be in the same situation but one could be more stressed than the other. We all want to be the person who is less stressed. How can we do that?</p>

											<h3>How to not be under a lot of stress.</h3>
											<p>1.) Manage your time. Time management can help prevent stressful last-minute work.</p>

											<p>2.) Get organized. This also deals with time management a bit, and can help you to plan ahead. It is a good idea to have a planner or notebook with you everywhere you go, so that if you are worried about something, you can write it down right away and not be stressed about forgetting about it.</p>
											<p>3.) Make time for others. Letting others know how you're doing will lift a weight off of your shoulders, and maybe a family member or a friend will be willing to help you out.</p>
											<p>4.) Excercise. Not only is it good for you, but it is also good for helping to clear the mind so that you can think about things rationally.</p>
											<p>5.) It is very, very, very, important to be calm when looking at stressful situations. If some bad news is dropped on you, take deep breaths in and out, breathing in for 5 seconds and breathing out for 5 seconds. Then think about some things you enjoy for a minute. Once you're head is cleared, calmly think about this and how you are going to deal with it. Is your best friend that you've known for ten years moving half-way across the world, and you've just had a fight? Find a time to apoligize within the next week, and prepare a few outings ahead of time. In a fight with your family? Think about it rationally from both perspectives, and invite them over for ice cream and a talk. Try not to blow your lid. Unexpected essay due the next day? Plan from what time to what time you will work on the first paragraph, the second, and the third, leaving breaks in between for snacks and a jog to help lift some weight.</p>
											<p>6.) Eat well. Most people know that being hungry makes people very, very grumpy. It's also hard to think properly when you're stomach is growling every ten seconds, so go pick up a bite to eat, cook up a big feast, do whatever you need to do to get the nutrients your body needs to keep plowing through your situation.</p>
											<p>7.) Sleep. Make sure you try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each day. Notice that I said in a day, because for some people seven hours of sleep a night is very hard to manage when work starts early and ends late. If you work from 8:00-5:00, take an half-hour nap as soon as you get home before doing whatever else you need to do. You might work until 9:00, and take an hour nap. Then you might work until 11:00, watch a movie til 12:00, and finally go to sleep at 1:00. Late right? But don't worry, because by the time you wake-up at 6:30, you'll have had 7 full hours of sleep that day.</p>
